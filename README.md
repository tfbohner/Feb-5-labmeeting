# Lab meeting Feb 5 - Bayesian modeling with brms

Please install the brms package in R and follow any additional instructions from pop-up menus in R. You may need to download additional software as the Stan models are compiled in C++. For those of you with macs, this will likely include the command line tools. For those of you on Windows I have no experience...so good luck! 

If for any reason you still run into problems, you can find all of the models saved as .rds files in this repo. You will still be able to manipulate the output and make whatever figures you like and you can troubleshoot later.

For those of you who don't use github much...to get to the files, click the <> Code button in the top left corner, then click the green Code button in the top right corner and select "Download ZIP".
